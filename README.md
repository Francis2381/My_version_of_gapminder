# My version of gapminder
 
Hans Rosling plot is one thing that I have always wanted to replicate when it comes to animated data visualization. The data was gotten from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who).
This is my first time trying to create an application using Bokeh and I decided to go all in.

This plot can simply be run from command prompt by navigating to this directory and typing 'Bokeh serve'. Well the gif below shows a glimpse of the output.
